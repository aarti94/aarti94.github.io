Selected constructs and framed them into a heirarchy to evaluate usability. Created survey questions, sourced from literature and adapted to this specific platform to assess each construct. Built the survey in REDCap and conducted pilot tests  Identified potential participant sources and drafted recruitment materials.   Conducted follow-up contextual interviews with users to better understand context of use and explore usability issues. Analysed data using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis in ATLAS.ti. Presented two potential avenues for redesign to client, each targeting a different user base.  Key Insights  Even though different user groups may have similar levels of familiarity with the concept and may use the tool for the same general purpose, differing contexts of use may drastically affect perceptions of usability and desired changes to the design.\n In this project, genetic counselors and statistical geneticists were both target users, as they understood the value of performing cosegregation analysis on their data and would be interested in using such a tool. Ultimately, however, their differing clinical vs. research contexts and other features of their professions led them to want completely different presentations of results which could not be reconciled. I finally ended up proposing two potential options for redesign to target the differing needs of these user groups.\n","date":1529020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529020800,"objectID":"5eae9c93981c1321fac514b8db1c4ec9","permalink":"https://aarti94.github.io/project/analyzemyvariant/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/analyzemyvariant/","section":"project","summary":"Assessed usability perceptions of AnalyzeMyVariant users","tags":null,"title":"UW Medicine-Usability Study for AnalyzeMyVariant","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary Tracking college students’ sleep patterns can help improve individual behavioral choices and allows the opportunity to make large scale policy changes to support students’ needs. I and a partner worked to research, design, prototype and evaluate an app-based data collection tool for students to self-report their sleep patterns.\nGoal To research, design, and evaluate an app-based data collection tool to let students record sleep data, and provide a means to collect crowd-sourced data for a citizen science project.\nIndustry \u0026amp; Audience  Industry: IT; Health management; citizen science Audience: Students at the University of Washington  Constraints  We had roughly 8 weeks to do this in, since it was part of required coursework. We had no prior knowledge of citizen science or sleep-based studies.  My Role  One in a team of two. Conducted half the contextual inquiries Helped design the initial layout, and gave design suggestion on first set of prototypes Designed and prototyped the layout and interactions for final interactive prototype (in Figma and Adobe XD).  Process  Identified and researched the design space of student sleep, potential health effects of lack of sleep, and various other studies designed to collect this type of data. Conducted 3 contextual inquiries with students about their use of sleep trackers, their planning of their schedule, and their use of other apps for health tracking. Used extensive literature review and contextual inquiries, and designed initial prototype in Balsamiq with validated measures and data collection formats from previous studies. Conducted longitudinal quantitative evaluations with prospective users to evaluate whether they remembered to submit data each day (using a low-fidelity paper prototype). Conducted a focus group session with other users, to gauge opinions of different design choices and motivational features. Modified designs and created high-fidelity, interactive prototypes in Figma and Adobe XD. Presented entire design project and offered suggestions for future development.  See the Figma prototype here.\nKey Insights  When designing a tool to collect data everyday, make everything as automatic as possible.\n In an attempt to keep the tool as simple and low-tech as possible, the initial design to collect sleep data required students to tap a timer ‘on’ as they were about to go to bed, and ‘off’ as soon as they woke up. But from longitudinal user evaluations conducted with low-fidelity prototypes, we found users would almost never remember to do both. Our revamped design recorded periods of phone inactivity and asked users later in the day whether the recorded period was correct.\n","date":1521072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521072000,"objectID":"5b1adf0c3277b9e7e76f31ec442e5b0a","permalink":"https://aarti94.github.io/project/citizenscience/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/citizenscience/","section":"project","summary":"Prototyped an app-based data collection tool for students to self-report their sleep patterns","tags":null,"title":"UW Design Study-Sleep Data for Citizen Science","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary Active Learning Classrooms (ALCs) have the potential to revolutionize the way classes are taught in a variety of disciplines. While they have been shown to be effective in promoting better conceptual understanding and retention of information, it is important to understand how the designs of these classrooms can affect teaching and learning. I conducted an 8-week fieldwork study within the Active Learning Classrooms at Odegaard Library to assess the user experiences of students and instructors using them.\nGoal To use fieldwork and ethnographic methods to observe and interview students and instructors using the space.\nTo understand students’ and instructors’ use of the space, and identify challenges and opportunities for future improvement.\nIndustry \u0026amp; Audience  Industry: IT; classroom design; user experience Audience: Instructors who conducted classes; students who attended classes and used the space for informal study after hours  Constraints Fieldwork could only be conducted for 8 weeks, the duration of the academic quarter.\nMy Role This was an individual project; I did everything.\nProcess  Acquired background information for adminstration about use and features of the space. Conducted hour-long observations for 8 weeks during a regular class and informal study hours. Wrote up extensive fieldwork notes and created visual maps of the room layout. Conducted multiple interviews with instructor and students. Qualitatively analyzed fieldnotes and interview transcripts through a process of open coding, creation of high-level thematic categories and follow-up deductive coding. Identified areas of challenge and potential improvement in the future use of the space as a formal classroom and informal study space. Provided insight about potential ideas for redesign of the library website for the Active Learning Classroom space.  Key Insights  Having great tools in a learning space is of no use unless users know they're there.\n Most of the students who used the ALCs for informal study were unfamiliar with the great features of the space, like the ability to connect laptops to the large TV screens at each table, or the ability to use the walls as whiteboards to draw on as they studied. In my final report, I proposed adding simple stickers somewhere visible at each table, directing students to the library website, where explanations of the space’s features were already available.\n Features can sometimes be used for purposes other than what they were intended for, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n 360-degree cameras installed in the classroom were originally intended to be used only for video-conferencing and remote learning purposes. However, instructors also used them to simply zoom in on themselves as they lectured or drew on the whiteboard, so that students at the opposite ends of the large room could see them the instructor on the closest TV screen. In a space designed with round tables, where students faced each other and the closest TV screen rather than the front of the room, this was a great idea to help increase visibility.\n","date":1513296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513296000,"objectID":"7b6c6fcd4e4c8fac3a805e913d4967f8","permalink":"https://aarti94.github.io/project/activelearning/","publishdate":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/activelearning/","section":"project","summary":"Assessed user experience of students and instructors using Active Learning Classrooms","tags":null,"title":"UW Libraries-Ethnography of Active Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary In addition to treating adolescents, doctors at the Division of Adolescent Medicine in Seattle Children’s Hospital created web-based content to guide parents in dealing with adolescent issues. I was part of a four-person student team that helped them come up with a method to make the content available to parents in the waiting room, via iPads.\nGoal To provide information for parents of teens about common adolescent health problems and useful resources to deal with them.\nIndustry \u0026amp; Audience  Industry: Health management; service design Audience: Parents in the Adolescent Medicine Clinic's waiting room  Constraints  Budget constraints, due to a lack of funding for this implementation. Only 5 iPads available. Only a few people to manage the implementation: design had to be of restricted burden to stakeholders. Time constraint: 8 weeks (part of coursework)  My Role  One in a team of four. Led one of the initial interviews; provided support for the rest. Created one of the personas and participated in brainstorming activities. Independently brainstormed and developed 3 prototypes for workflow of iPad acquisition and use by parents (team members prototyped other aspects like security and iPad functionality). Consolidated different features into final design with team.  Process  Acquired background understanding of design space from key members of clinic team. Toured the space, and conducted longer interviews with key stakeholders such as the the department head, content developer, the administrative manager, and front desk manager. Created a requirements analysis document and identified design goals.  Created personas and models to understand the design space.   Create multiple design ideas for each aspect of the implementation: iPad functionality, security options, workflow, and evaluation. Selected two holistic design ideas to present to the client. Presented our findings and design ideas to the stakeholders in the Division of Adolescent Medicine, along with our scheme for evaluating usability, once the implementation was in place.  Key Insights  Use of models, like use case and cultural models, can really help to define the design constraints and understand limitations.\n While the concept of this design (to deliver adolescent healthcare information and tips to parents) would be of great use to the intended users, this project did not have a lot of funding, tools or personnel available to dedicate to the delivery of this service. By using interviews to build up various models of the space, we were able to understand these limitations and design low-maintenance designs around these considerations.\n","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"fb01a352b84b1c9fd82281773cfbc9d4","permalink":"https://aarti94.github.io/project/seattlehospital/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/seattlehospital/","section":"project","summary":"Provide information for parents of teens about common adoloscent health problems","tags":null,"title":"Seattle Children's Hospital-iPad Service Design for Adolescent Care","type":"project"}]
